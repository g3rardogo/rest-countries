## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control system
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocesor

### What I learned

This is my first project using React and what I learned from it is to using React Router DOM and React Hooks. This are some code snippets that im proud of:

```js
//Search country Hook
function useSearchCountries(countries) {
  const [query, setQuery] = React.useState("");
  const [filteredCountries, setFilteredCountries] = React.useState(countries);
  React.useMemo(() => {
    const result = countries.filter((country) => {
      return `${country.name}`.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase());
    });
    setFilteredCountries(result);
  }, [countries, query]);
  return { query, setQuery, filteredCountries };
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to start learning more about React Hooks and then apply them in all the components
